Toolbox2docker
==================================

[![docker toolbox logo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/251292/9585188/2f31d668-4fca-11e5-86c9-826d18cf45fd.png)](https://www.docker.com/toolbox)


This is a fork of Docker Toolbox (https://github.com/docker/toolbox)

See [Ceasing Support and Development of Docker Toolbox #898](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/issues/898)

Why a fork? I still find it useful.

NOTE: 

Releases >= 20.10.9:

docker-machine has now been patched to pull the boot2docker-xfs-ng ISO from
the [kaosagnt/boot2docker-xfs-ng](https://github.com/kaosagnt/boot2docker-xfs-ng)
repository.

This version of docker-machine contains all patches from the GitLab fork and
contains other fixes on top. It will continue to pull in patches from GitLab.
The Source tree can be found at [kaosagnt/docker-machine](https://github.com/kaosagnt/docker-machine).

Previous releases <=20.10.8:

docker-machine will pull by default the obsoleted boot2docker project ISO.

To get around this issue you will need to use the docker-machine option to point
the URL to the boot2docker.iso file that ships with this toolbox2docker distribution
and manually create a virtual machine.

	docker-machine create -d ${VIRTUAL_DRIVER} ${VIRTUAL_MEMORY} \
	--${VIRTUAL_DRIVER}-boot2docker-url "file://some/path/to/file" \
	${VIRTUAL_CPU_COUNT} ${VIRTUAL_SWITCH} ${VM_MACHINE_NAME}

	--${VIRTUAL_DRIVER}-boot2docker-url "file://path/to/boot2docker.iso"
	
	where ${VIRTUAL_driver} is the driver for the Virtual machine software you are using
		virtualbox
		vmware
		vmwarefusion
		hyperv

This will also give your VM the XFS filesystem instead of EXT4 as it will be
created with the correct ISO.

The location of the boot2docker ISO on a default install:

	macOS: /usr/local/share/boot2docker/boot2docker.iso
	windows: /c/Program Files/toolbox2docker/boot2docker.iso


NOTE: Virtualbox on macOS requires manual intervention to workaround a
Virtualbox security feature. [See:](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/20626)

Before running the "Docker Quickstart Terminal" for the first time, follow
the insrtuctions in the Virtualbox [Manual](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html)

Section: 6.7. Host-Only Networking

	On Linux, Mac OS X and Solaris Oracle VM VirtualBox will only allow IP addresses in 192.168.56.0/21 range to be assigned to host-only adapters. For IPv6 only link-local addresses are allowed. If other ranges are desired, they can be enabled by creating /etc/vbox/networks.conf and specifying allowed ranges there. For example, to allow 10.0.0.0/8 and 192.168.0.0/16 IPv4 ranges as well as 2001::/64 range put the following lines into /etc/vbox/networks.conf:
	
	* 10.0.0.0/8 192.168.0.0/16
	* 2001::/64
	
	Lines starting with the hash # are ignored. Next example allows any addresses, effectively disabling range control:
	
	* 0.0.0.0/0 ::/0

If the file exists, but no ranges are specified in it, no addresses will be assigned to host-only adapters. The following example effectively disables all ranges:

	# No addresses are allowed for host-only adapters


XXX TODO: fix documentation


The Toolbox2docker installs everything you need to get started with
Docker on Mac OS X and Windows. It includes the Docker client, Compose,
Machine and VirtualBox.

## Installation and documentation

Documentation for Mac [is available here](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/).

Documentation for Windows [is available here](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/). 

*Note:* Some Windows and Mac computers may not have VT-X enabled by default. It is required for VirtualBox. To check if VT-X is enabled on Windows follow this guide [here](http://amiduos.com/support/knowledge-base/article/how-can-i-get-to-know-my-processor-supports-virtualization-technology). To enable VT-X on Windows, please see the guide [here](http://www.howtogeek.com/213795/how-to-enable-intel-vt-x-in-your-computers-bios-or-uefi-firmware). To enable VT-X on Intel-based Macs, refer to this Apple guide [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203296).
Also note that if the Virtual Machine was created before enabling VT-X it can be necessary to remove and reinstall the VM for Docker Toolbox to work.

Toolbox is currently unavailable for Linux; To get started with Docker on Linux, please follow the Linux [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.docker.com/linux/started/).

## Building Toolbox2docker

Toolbox2docker installers are built using Docker, so you'll need a Docker host set up. For example, using [Docker Machine](https://github.com/docker/machine):

```
$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox toolbox
$ eval "$(docker-machine env toolbox)"
```

Then, to build Toolbox2docker for both platforms:

```
make
```

Build for a specific platform:

```
make osx
```

or

```
make windows
```

The resulting installers will be in the `dist` directory.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I have to install VirtualBox?**

No, there is a lite version that comes without VirtualBox.

You can also deselect VirtualBox during installation in the default installer. It is bundled in case you want to have a working environment for free.
